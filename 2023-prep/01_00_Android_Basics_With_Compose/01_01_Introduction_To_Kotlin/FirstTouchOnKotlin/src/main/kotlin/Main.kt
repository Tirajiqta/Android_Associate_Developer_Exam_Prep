/* NOTES:
You need something called the Kotlin compiler, which takes the Kotlin code you wrote,
looks at it line by line, and translates it into something that the computer can understand.
This process is called compiling your code.

If your code compiles successfully, your program will run (or execute). \
When the computer executes your program, it performs each of your instructions.
If you've ever followed a cooking recipe, performing each step in the recipe is considered executing each instruction.

A Kotlin program is required to have a main function, which is the specific place in your code where the program starts running.
The main function is the entry point, or starting point, of the program.
A function is a segment of a program that performs a specific task.
Your program may have one or more functions.
These are the key parts needed to define a function:
    The function needs a name, so you can call it later.
    The function can also require some inputs, or information that needs to be provided when the function is called. The function uses these inputs to accomplish its purpose. Requiring inputs is optional, and some functions do not require inputs.
    The function also has a body which contains the instructions to perform the task.
Example code: fun name( input ){ body }
